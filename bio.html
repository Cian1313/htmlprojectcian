        <h3>Cian O'Sullivan</h3>
        <p>Since first year I have always had a great interest in the subject
        of business. However, accounting was the one that sparked the greatest
        passion. Its mathematical foundations was one of the reasons I chose 
        accounting for the Leaving Certificate. I also took Higher level maths
        and physics.In addition to the business subjects, I am drawn to everything 
        relating to I.T. and technology. I attended CoderDojo workshops in Tralee 
        Institute of Technology. Starting in second year through to Transition Year, 
        I engaged in a number of workshops which introduced me to the world of 
        computer programming. This played a huge part in shaping my future and 
        the career path I now wish to take.It was with much thought and reflection 
        I chose to study ‘Business Information Systems’ at UCC. I felt this is the 
        perfect fit for me as it combines my interest in business and computing. </p>
